## About the project

The project mainly focuses on enhancing the Search and improving the code structure for the same in the CDLI framework and adding new features to it using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) and [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/).

<i>Proposal</i> : [Search Enhancements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N5AqM5AbE7UVa9rax5_KRReH1v9c8lGzWKyVhd26xMc/edit?usp=sharing)\

## Preview of objectives

### 1. Show number of hits in the parenthesis
  - *Final outcome:*\
      Users will be able see number of hits in the parenthesis before applying a filter.
  - *Methodology:*
      * Used Elasticsearch buckets aggregations to count number of hits in every search.

| Search results for "1156" in Keyword's field. |

</center>

### 2. Search Filter Problem 
 - *Final outcome:*\
    All filter categories are updated after applying an individual filter or more.
 - *Methodology:*
     * Used ElasticSearch Buckets to verify the existence of a filter category.

| Applying 'clay' filter category after searching for "1156" in Free Search|

</center>

### 3. Search breaks when searching for a certain string

- *Final outcome:*\
   Users would be able to search using more symbols and signs.
- *Methodology:*
    * Using '//' before any reserved character in the searched keyword.

| Search results for "HS 1475(+)" in Free search|

</center>

### 4. search children entities

- *Final outcome:*\
   * Filter categories are updated to show parent-child relationship using "->" symbol. 
   * Results for children entities would also be include when the user searches for a parent.
- *Methodology:*
   * using tables from database to create the required mappings.
   * Then use those mappings to get required results.

### 5. Encode Elasticsearch queries using JSON

- *Final outcome:*\
   ElasticSearch queries are more readable and appendable 
- *Methodology:*
   * Using PHP `json_encode()` to encode the  query which is in array format and then pass to a GET request for expected results from ElasticSearch.

| Removed "Museum collections" and "Period" from search results by modifing Search Settings.  |

### 6. Extend Free Search

- *Final outcome:*\
   More fields to search and hence more results and data for the users.
- *Methodology:*
   * Adding fields using logstash pipeline and then adding them to respective fields

## To Do (Post GSoC)

* Robust Testing of all newly added features.
* Documentation (User's and Developer's)
* Fixing any bugs that arise from all the implemented features.

## Acknowledgements

Google Summer Of Code 2022 was a challenging and constructive experience. I have learned new technologies and in addition I have understood  the fundamentals of working on a real time Software Project. I would like to thank my mentor [Yashraj Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashraj-desai-55a78a1a5/) for his guidance. I have learned a lot from him and his methodolgy in guiding me. I also appreciate the help from [Lar Willighaegan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lars-willighagen/) and [Ã‰milie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/epageperron/) for guiding me and helping me throughout my GSoC journey. I will always be grateful to [CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu/) for being such a hospitable organization.
